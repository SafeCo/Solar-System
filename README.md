## What I learnt

Through my journey of learning I realised that good website often have nuanced animations.T his project was my attempt in gaining familarity with animations within CSS.

I learnt how Javascript can be used to manipulate all styling on the DOM including animations. I also learnt of when to utilise keyframes and transitions and the different ways in which they can be written to add finer control to the animation e.g. Kefyrame from and to or keyframes 0% to 100%.

I also realised the various ways DOM elements can be utilised to create shapes rather than simply importing an image.
